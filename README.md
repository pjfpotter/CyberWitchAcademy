This is my NANNOGENMO 2020 entry. 

It is a 64,249 word novel written using Daniel Howe's RiTa Node Package, it's basically a Markovian remix of my own unfinished novel.

I used 20,000 words of notes and drafting of my unfinished novel as a source text for generating Markov chains.

If you want to recreate this you will need:

NODE.JS and the RiTa Node Package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/rita

A text editor (I used visual studio code)
Command Line (I used windows power shell)

And if you're totally new to NODE then I recommend the following videos:

I watched the series on discord bots, made a discord bot and then realised it would be super easy to use the same workflow to make enormous Markov chains.
